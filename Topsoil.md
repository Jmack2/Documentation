#Topsoil Documentation Overview
Topsoil is a desktop application and Java library that creates data visualizations for geochronologists and other earth scientists. 
The project is led and maintained by CIRDLES, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina."Topsoil" is an anagram of "Isoplot", the name of an enormously successful Microsoft Excel Add-In with similar capabilities that now works only in older versions of Excel.



#Information for use of Documentation
The documentation below is essentially a set of step by step instructions on how to operate the software. For auditory and visual learners, youtube video tutorials will be included among the written instructions, so there will be a video demonstration of Topsoil operations from a desktop.

#Concept of operations
The purpose of Topsoil is to allow people to use visualize geochronology data, whether self-generated or from another source.
