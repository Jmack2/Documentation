#CHRONI Documentation Overview
	-Chroni is a mobile application that presents archived data downloaded from the Geochron database in a customizable format for use
	by geologists in the field. Currently, the Chroni application only works with Android devices, but an IOS application is in
	development. The project is led and maintained by CIRDLES, an undergraduate research lab at the College of Charleston in
	Charleston, South Carolina.


#Information for use of Documentation
	-The documentation below is essentially a set of step by step instructions on how to operate the software. For auditory and visual
	learners, youtube video tutorials will be included among the written instructions, so there will be a video demonstration of
	CHRONI operations from an android phone ( or tablet).

#Concept of operations
	-The purpose of Chroni is to allow people to archive data, while collecting data in the field. With CHRONI, users do not need to remain stationary.
	
#Policies that affect the system
	-This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers 0930223 and 1443037. Any
	opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not
